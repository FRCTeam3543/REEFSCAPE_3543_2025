## ARCHIVED CODE: NOT IN USE
### New Code (:https://github.com/FRCTeam3543/3543_Rebuilt_RobotCode)

Created Using: YAGSL from Bronc Botz, Modified by: Madeline Smith from C4 Robotics



# Yet Another Generic Swerve Library (YAGSL) Example project

YAGSL is intended to be an easy implementation of a generic swerve drive that should work for most
square swerve drives. The project is documented
on [here](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL/wiki). The JSON documentation can also be
found [here](docs/START.md)

This example is intended to be a starting place on how to use YAGSL. By no means is this intended to
be the base of your robot project. YAGSL provides an easy way to generate a SwerveDrive which can be
used in both TimedRobot and Command-Based Robot templates.

# Special Thanks to Team 7900! Trial N' Terror
Without the debugging and aid of Team 7900 the project could never be as stable or active as it is.
